# Homebridge Bosch Smart Home integration

The main goal is to make Energy metering available for Bosch compact plugs.
The plug and Bosch smart home support it, but presumably because Apple Home does not support metering, the homekit integration doesn't provide the information,
or the Eve does not support reading it from Bosch devices.

Long story short, we now translate the Bosch Smart Plug and present it as an Eve plug.
